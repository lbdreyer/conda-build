# for packages that list only build requirements (not host), we should treat build as host
#      otherwise, we can end up with python in build, and then new things don't get installed, because host
#      is where we bundle stuff from.  However, when {{ compiler() }} is in the recipe, we don't do this,
#      because people are then using advanced features and shouldn't need the training wheels, which might
#      get in the way.
