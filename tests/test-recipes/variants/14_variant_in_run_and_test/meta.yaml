# in this recipe, both the click variant and the pytest variant are underspecified for conda.
#   In conda-build <3.0.15, this recipe will fail, with unsatisfiable dependencies.  In 3.0.15,
#   we add .* to underspecified variant versions in run and test deps, but we also warn people
#   that it would be better if they used better specs (provide .* themselves, or use >/< expressions
