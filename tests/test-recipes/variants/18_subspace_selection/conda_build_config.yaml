# this test ensures that we can merge and clobber fields that are part of zip_keys, and it will reduce
#    any other associated zip keys

# There's two ways this will work:
#   1. people specify one key, say a, but not b.  The value of that key must already exist in a.  We select
#      the matching set.  Here, if we select a: coffe, the set we get is [{a: coffee, b: 123}, {a: coffee, b: abc}]
#   2. people specify more than one key:
#       - select dimensions when keys match
#       - if any key does not match, assert that all dimensions in zip_keys are specified, and rather than selecting
#         subspace, clobber the other existing space

a:
  - coffee
  - coffee
  - llama
b:
  - 123
  - abc
  - concrete
c:
  - mooo
  - baaa
  - woof
zip_keys:
  - a
  - b
  - c
